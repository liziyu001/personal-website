      <p className="white-text p-tag">
        I will be graduating from Purdue University in May 2025 with dual B.S.
        degrees in Computer Science and Data Science. I have demonstrated
        excellent academic performance, maintaining a 4.0 major GPA and earning
        A+ grades in challenging courses such as Cryptography, Compiler
        Principles and Practices, and Operating Systems. Since my first year at
        university, I have been striving to connect my academic expertise with
        practical applications, completing several internships and projects. My
        can-do attitude, innovative ideas, and dedication have been consistently
        recognized and praised by mentors and leaders. Additionally, my
        enthusiasm for problem-solving and perseverance have made me a highly
        regarded teaching assistant and researcher.
